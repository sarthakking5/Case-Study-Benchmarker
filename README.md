🏭 Campus Heilbronn — Manufacturing Case Study Benchmarker

A template framework to standardize manufacturing datasets (e.g., FJSSP), create reproducible case studies, and benchmark algorithms with built-in baseline solvers and an evaluation environment.

- ✅ CSV/JSON ingestion → cleaned, standardized schema (Pydantic)

- ✅ Baseline solvers (Random, Greedy; optional OR-Tools placeholder)

- ✅ CLI (runner.py) to standardize, list, and run benchmarks

- ✅ End-to-end pipeline script (standardize → list → run)

- ✅ Ready for researchers to plug in custom algorithms
